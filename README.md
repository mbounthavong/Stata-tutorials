## Linear spline (or piecewise) models in Stata
A tutorial on how to construct linear spline (also known as piecewise) models using Stata is available on my [RPubs site](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/linear_spline_stata). 

The Stata code is located [here](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Stata-tutorials/tree/main/Linear%20spline%20model/Stata%20code).
