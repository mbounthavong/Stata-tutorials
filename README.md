## Linear spline (or piecewise) models in Stata
A tutorial on how to construct linear spline (also known as piecewise) models using Stata is available on my [RPubs site](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/linear_spline_stata). 

The `Stata` code is located [here](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Stata-tutorials/tree/main/Linear%20spline%20model/Stata%20code).

## Using `marginsplot` and `mplotoffset` to visualize average marginal effects in Stata
A tutorial on how to use Stata's `marginsplot` and `mplotoffset` to visualize average marginal effect, particularly interactoin terms. The tutorial is located on my RPubs site [link](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/stata_marginsplot_mplotoffset).

The `Stata` code is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbounthavong/Stata-tutorials/refs/heads/main/marginsplot%20and%20mplotoffset%20tutorial/Stata%20code/marginsplot_mplotoffset_tutorial.do).
